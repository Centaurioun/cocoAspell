Standard Aspell languages

It is not required but encouraged to localize these languages and regions.
cocoAspell will handle most of the naming by default. It will use system-wide names
for the languages in the current locale and the "(RG)" abbreviation for the region code. 
For example, fr_FR will be shown as "French (FR)" under English language.

However, some of the localizations are missing from OS X and it is unknown when they 
will be available. In case of such localizations your languages will be named in English.
